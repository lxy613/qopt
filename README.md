# qopt
Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms for Optimization problems

This repository contains some unpublished before source codes developed by Robert Nowotniak in the years
2010-2015. They were used for research on advanced randomised search
algorithms (mainly quantum-inspired evolutionary and genetic algorithms and
other population methods) for numerical and combinatorial optimisation. 

The programs and algorithms were developed in different programming languages:
C, C++, Python with Cython interfaces, CUDA C kernels, helpers Bash shell scripts and some algorithms even in Matlab.

The [source code repository](https://github.com/rnowotniak/qopt) main contents:

* **Algorithms/purepython/** -  algorithms implementation in pure Python (the slowest, initial POC implementations)
* **Algorithms/*.pyx**  -   iQIEA, MyRQIEA2, QIEA1, QIEA2, rQIEA algorithms implementation in Cython
* **C/**  -  some algorithms and test problems implementation in C++
* **CUDA/**  -  CUDA C computational kernels implementing a few algorithms in GPGPUs (superb fast, up to several hundred speedup in multi GPU environment)
* **problems/** -  different numerical optimization functions, knapsack problem, SLAM, SAT (boolean satisfiability problem) encoding different combinatorial problems, also functions from CEC2005, CEC2011, CEC2013 benchmarks
* **EXPERIMENTS/** -  high level repeatable procedures for some experiments (analysis of search domain coverage by schemata, building blocks propagation analysis, histograms charts, speed tests, algorithms convergence analysis etc.)
* **analysis/**   -  auxiliary scripts for results analysis and visualization
* **make**   -  Bash shell script to build all this project
* **test.py**  -  Python script demonstrating how to run some implemented algorithms on a few test problems + results validation
* **contrib/**   -  third-party tools referenced in experiments and copied here

## Examples

Import algorithms from `qopt` and some test problems:

```python
import qopt.algorithms
import qopt.problems
```

Loading test functions / benchmark problems:

```python
# knapsack
knapsack = qopt.problems.knapsack250
print knapsack.evaluate('1' * 250)

# func 1d
f1d = qopt.problems.func1d.f1
print f1d.evaluate2(60.488)

# sat
import qopt.problems._sat
s1 = qopt.problems._sat.SatProblem('problems/sat/flat30-100.cnf')
print s1.evaluate('100100001100100100001100010100010001010010100010100010010010010010001001001100001001001001')

# cec2005
f1 = qopt.problems.CEC2005(1)
print f1.evaluate((0,0))

f1 = qopt.problems.CEC2013(8)
print f1.evaluate(qopt.problems.CEC2013.optimum[:2])
```

Solving combinatorial optimization using a little customized QIGA algorithm (overwriting initialize() and generation() methods):

```python
class QIGA(qopt.algorithms.QIGA):
    def initialize(self):
        super(QIGA, self).initialize()
        print 'my initialization'
        print self.Q

    def generation(self):
        super(QIGA, self).generation()
        if self.t == 5:
            print 'generation %d, bestval: %g' % (self.t, self.bestval)

q = QIGA(chromlen = 250)
q.tmax = 500
q.problem = qopt.problems.knapsack250
import time
t1 = time.time()
for run in xrange(1):
    q.run()
print '100 runs in: %g seconds' % (time.time() - t1)
q.run()

print q.bestval
```

Solving numerical optimization problems using implemented RQIEA algorithm:

```python
# cec2005
r = qopt.algorithms.RQIEA
r.problem = qopt.problems.CEC2005(2)
r.dim = 30
r.bounds = None
r.run()

# cec2011
r.problem = qopt.problems.CEC2011(15)
r.run()
